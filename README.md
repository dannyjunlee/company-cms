## Installation

To get the development environment running, the user must install MySQL2, Inquirer v.8.2.4, and the console.table npm packages.

This can be done by opening the command line and typing "npm init -y", then "npm i mysql2 inquirer@8.2.4 console.table".

Before launching the application, the user must first initialize the data through MySQL.

This can be done by opening MySQL through "mysql -u root -p", entering password, then inputting "source" + the schema.sql and seeds.sql files.
